Your readme should include the following information. Each student needs to submit all of this information themselves, even when pair programming. 

Group Member Name(s): Evelyn Ray

Other collaborators you worked with, including TAs (and feel free to give a shoutout to anyone who was particularly helpful): Ruby, Professor Hia

Any references used besides JavaDoc and course materials: I used microsoft copiolot to figure out an issue I was having with my brackets. I discovered that I closed one too early, causing the while loop at the end to execute every time an operator was processed instead of just at the end.

Reflection on your experience with this assignment:
I had a lot of issues with my assigment just due to small errors. I struggled with parentheses because my brackets were misconfigured in my infix class, but once I was able to fix that I found it easy to finish my other bugs.

This assignment does lend itself to more visual prototyping, so please feel free to go this route. Are you including slides, pseudocode, comments, or something else?

I am not! I didn't think to do this and just went straight into it, but it may have helped if I had!
